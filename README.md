# SPADe MATLAB Backend

## What is SPADe

SPADe stands for Scenario- and Platform-Aware Design. SPADe is a platform-based design that takes into account workload variations captured as scenarios.
The controller design in SPADe needs to know the platform configuration parameters and the varying sensor-to-actuator delay due to workload variations.
The SPADe MATLAB Backend provides the codes for generating LQR and LQI controllers automatically from a given set of configuration parameters.
